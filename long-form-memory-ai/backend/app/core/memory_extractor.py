        self.extraction_prompt = """You are a comprehensive memory extraction system. Extract ALL important information from the conversation that could be useful in future interactions. Be thorough and capture details that might seem minor but could be relevant later.

Extract memories in these categories:
1. **preference**: User likes, dislikes, choices, favorites (language, style, timing, entertainment, food, etc.)
2. **fact**: Personal information, demographics, background, education, work, family details
3. **entity**: Important people, places, organizations, brands, specific items mentioned
4. **commitment**: Promises, scheduled events, deadlines, plans, intentions
5. **instruction**: Explicit instructions on how to behave or respond
6. **constraint**: Limitations, restrictions, boundaries, things to avoid
7. **habit**: Routines, patterns, regular behaviors (e.g., "I usually wake up at 7am")
8. **opinion**: Strong feelings, beliefs, values, perspectives on topics
9. **temporary_state**: Current situations, moods, ongoing projects (may be less permanent)
10. **goal**: Aspirations, targets, things user wants to achieve

DETAILED EXTRACTION RULES:
- Extract BOTH specific and general preferences
- Capture numbers, quantities, time references
- Note emotional reactions (likes, hates, loves, fears)
- Remember context around preferences (e.g., "only on weekends", "when I'm stressed")
- Extract relationships and social connections
- Capture ANY pattern or routine the user mentions
- Note professional/educational background details
- Extract health information, dietary restrictions, allergies
- Remember entertainment preferences in detail

GENERAL PREFERENCE PATTERN EXAMPLES:
- "In any anime, my favorite character is the main character" -> preference: favorite_anime_character_type = main character
- "I usually prefer vegetarian food but eat meat on weekends" -> preference: dietary_preference = vegetarian, constraint: dietary_exception = meat_on_weekends
- "I wake up at 7am on weekdays" -> habit: wake_up_weekday_time = 7am
- "My sister works at Google" -> entity: sister_workplace = Google, fact: has_sister = yes

For each memory found, provide:
- type: One of the categories above
- key: Specific, semantic identifier (e.g., "favorite_movie_genre", "sister_name")
- value: The exact information to remember (include numbers, names, specifics)
- confidence: 0.0 to 1.0 score (how certain you are this is correct)
- importance: 0.0 to 1.0 score (how critical this is for future conversations)

Conversation:
{conversation}

Respond ONLY with a JSON array of memories. If no memories found, return empty array [].
Example:
[
  {{
    "type": "preference",
    "key": "language_preference",
    "value": "Kannada",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "importance": 0.8

    "key": "morning_routine",
    "value": "wakes up at 7am on weekdays",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "importance": 0.6
